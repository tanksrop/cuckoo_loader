# Cuckoo loader
This project is a resurection of the Nest Thermostat DFU attack, originally published by exploitee.rs

DISCLAIMER: Use this at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any loss, damage, bricked devices, etc.

The orginal project has "rusted" somewhat as technology has moved on. 

The following issues have been resolved:
 - omap3_loader tool does not work on modern systems.
 - "modern" omap_loader tool did not send a compatible jump command.
 - x-loader used in the original exploit is not compatible with alternate nand chips used on some nest thermostats.
 - build issues with u-boot.
 - build issues with linux.

## Usage
There are two main steps to getting this to run:

### Build
Run the build.sh script. This will download numerous sources, apply patches and build all the various binaries.

### Run the exploit
Run the ./load_firmware.sh script. Once started, press and hold down the screen on the nest for approx 10s. You should see activity as follows:
```
[+] jump command: 0x6a425355
[+] jump command le: 0x6a425355
OMAP Loader 1.0.0
File 'x-load.bin' at 0x40200000, size 27868
File 'u-boot.bin' at 0x80100000, size 246572
File 'uImage' at 0x80a00000, size 6972252
[+] scanning for USB device matching 0451:d00e...

[+] uploading 'u-boot.bin' (size 246572) to 0x80100000
[+] uploading 'uImage' (size 6972252) to 0x80a00000
[+] sending jump command: 0x6a425355, 0x80100000, 12
[+] jumping to address 0x80100000
[+] successfully transfered 3 files
```

The nest will then reboot and apply the original exploit which will install an ssh server and reset the root password

The new default root password is: `gtvh4ckr`

Note: This has only been ran on an older linux laptop. Millage may vary but feel free to open issues.

# Issues building
The toolchain was compiled for 32 bit systems. If you are trying to compile on 64bit systems, the following guide may help:

## What next
Well.. you have root. There is a lot you can do from here. Please remember to change the default password. 

I will be adding more repos in relation to this project as time goes on. 

## Whats the name about
This forms part of a project I am naming Cuckoo. It is taken from the bird that moves into other species nests and lays their own eggs. Feels fitting.
